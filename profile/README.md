# Welcome to Catena-X NG ðŸ™Œ

For further information check out our Project Page or our pinned repositories:
- [Catena-X (ng) Project page](https://catenax-ng.github.io/)

The [Catena-X NG GitHub Organization](https://github.com/catenax-ng) was initiated by the [Catena-X Consortia](https://catena-x.net/de/) to support the transition to our official open-source Project [Eclipse Tractus-X](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/automotive.tractusx).

Currently, some product teams are still working in [Catena-X NG](https://github.com/catenax-ng), but will move to [Tractus-X](https://github.com/eclipse-tractusx) asap. After successful transition the goal is to depreciate this GitHub organisation.
